Primary Features
------------------
	director:manages how and when to execute the Scenes
	node:the main element, anything thats gets drawn or contains things that get drawn is a CCNode
	layer:inherites from node and implements the TouchEventsDelegate protocol 
	scene:organizes the nodes and then run, actually shown, by the director 
	sprite:a kind of node binding a 2d image with corresponding features
	menu:responses to the clicks 
	labelttf:be used to render text labels
	particle system:nearly thirty particle examples are shown in tests, supports plist
	tilemap:a kind of map that is composed of many texture tiles
	cocosdenshion:offer the interfaces to play background music and sound effect
